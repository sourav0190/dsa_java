// Rat in a Maze

// You are given a starting position for a rat which is stuck in a maze at an initial point (0, 0) (the maze can be thought of as a 2-dimensional plane). The maze would be given in the form of a square matrix of order N * N where the cells with value 0 represent the mazeâ€™s blocked locations while value 1 is the open/available path that the rat can take to reach its destination.
// The rat's destination is at (N - 1, N - 1).
// Your task is to find all the possible paths that the rat can take to reach from source to destination in the maze.

// The possible directions that it can take to move in the maze are

// 'U' (up) i.e. (x, y - 1)

// 'D' (down) i.e. (x, y + 1)

// 'L' (left) i.e. (x - 1, y)

// 'R' (right) i.e. (x + 1, y).
